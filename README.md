ii: USAGE -Layout is as it appears and is responsive. When the quiz begins, the description section is replaced with a question and answer prompt and the timer in the top right corner starts. If a question is answered incorrectly, 5 seconds are subtracted from the total time. The time left at the end of the quiz is shown on the final quiz page as the user's score. The user then has the option of inputting their initials to save with their score to localStorage for retrieval for a High Scores page. On the High Scores page, the user can keep track of or clear scores saved to localStorage.
